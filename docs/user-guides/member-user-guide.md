# Organization Subscription - Member User Guide

## Introduction

This guide is for educators and students who receive subscription access through their organization (school, college, or university). Learn how to view your organization-provided features and manage personal add-ons.

## Understanding Your Subscription

### Organization-Provided vs Personal

Your subscription access comes from two sources:

| Source | Description | Who Manages |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Organization-Provided** | Features your school/college provides | Your admin |
| **Personal Add-ons** | Features you purchase yourself | You |

Organization-provided features are managed by your admin. You cannot modify or cancel them.

## Viewing Your Subscription

### Accessing Subscription Page

1. Log in to your account
2. Go to **My Subscription** in the sidebar (or profile menu)
3. View your subscription status

### Organization-Provided Features

The **Organization Features** section shows:

- **Features Included**: List of features you have access to
- **Provided By**: Your organization's name
- **Valid Until**: When your access expires
- **Admin Contact**: Who to contact for questions

Look for the **"Managed by [Organization Name]"** badge on organization-provided features.

### Feature Access

Organization-provided features work just like personal subscriptions:
- Full access to all included features
- No additional payment required
- Access continues until your admin removes it or subscription expires

## Personal Add-ons

### What Are Add-ons?

Add-ons are additional features you can purchase for yourself, separate from what your organization provides. Examples:
- Premium AI features
- Additional storage
- Advanced analytics

### Purchasing Add-ons

1. Go to **My Subscription** → **Available Add-ons**
2. Browse available add-ons
3. Click **Purchase** on desired add-on
4. Complete payment
5. Access immediately available

### Managing Your Add-ons

View your personal add-ons in the **Personal Add-ons** section:
- See active add-ons
- View expiration dates
- Renew or cancel

> **Note**: Personal add-ons are separate from organization subscriptions. Cancelling one doesn't affect the other.

## Expiration and Renewal

### Organization Subscription Expiration
