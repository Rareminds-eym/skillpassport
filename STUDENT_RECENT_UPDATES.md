# Student Recent Updates Implementation

## Overview
Replaced mock `recentUpdates` in student dashboard with real-time activities from recruitment tables. Students now see actual recruiter actions related to them.

## Architecture

### 1. Service Layer
**File**: `src/services/studentActivityService.js`

Fetches activities from 5 tables filtered by student:
- `shortlist_candidates` - When student gets shortlisted
- `pipeline_activities` - Student's recruitment journey  
- `pipeline_candidates` - Stage changes
- `offers` - Job offers extended to student
- `placements` - Final hiring/placement updates

### 2. React Query Hook
**File**: `src/hooks/useStudentRealtimeActivities.js`

Features:
- Fetches activities via React Query (with caching)
- Real-time subscriptions to Supabase changes
- Auto-refetches when recruitment actions occur
- Filters all tables by student ID/email

### 3. Dashboard Integration
**File**: `src/components/Students/components/Dashboard.jsx`

Changes:
- Imports `useStudentRealtimeActivities` hook
- Replaces mock data with real activities
- Shows loading states
- Color-codes activities by type
- Displays recruiter name, action, and timestamp

## Database Tables Used

| Table | Purpose | Filter |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `shortlist_candidates` | Shortlist additions | `student_id = ?` |
| `pipeline_activities` | Pipeline updates | `student_id = ?` |
| `pipeline_candidates` | Stage changes | `candidate_name = ?` |
| `offers` | Offer letters | `candidate_name = ?` |
| `placements` | Final placements | `studentId = ?` |

## Activity Types & Colors

```javascript
{
  'shortlist_added': 'Yellow',      // Student shortlisted
  'offer_extended': 'Green',        // Offer sent
  'offer_accepted': 'Emerald',      // Offer accepted
  'placement_hired': 'Purple',      // Final hire
  'stage_change': 'Indigo',         // Pipeline stage change
  'application_rejected': 'Red',    // Application rejected
  'pipeline_update': 'Blue'         // General updates
}
```

## Example Activities

### Shortlist Activity
```javascript
{
  user: "Sarah Johnson",
  action: "shortlisted you for",
  candidate: "Frontend Engineers",
  details: "Added to recruiter shortlist",
  type: "shortlist_added"
}
```

### Offer Activity
```javascript
{
  user: "HR Team",
  action: "extended an offer to you",
  candidate: "Software Engineer",
  details: "Software Engineer - ₹8 LPA",
  type: "offer_extended"
}
```

### Pipeline Activity
```javascript
{
  user: "Recruitment Team",
  action: "moved you from Interview to Offer",
  details: "Pipeline stage update",
  type: "pipeline_update"
}
```

## Real-time Updates

The system subscribes to Supabase real-time channels:
- Listens for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE events
- Filters by student ID where possible
- Auto-refetches activities on changes
- Shows live updates without page refresh

## UI Features

1. **Loading State**: Spinner while fetching activities
2. **Empty State**: Message when no activities exist
3. **Badge Count**: Shows total number of activities
4. **Color Coding**: Different colors for activity types
5. **Expand/Collapse**: Show 4 or all activities
6. **Timestamps**: Formatted dates or relative time

## Benefits

✅ **Real Data**: No more mock data - shows actual recruitment activities  
✅ **Student-Centric**: Only shows activities relevant to logged-in student  
✅ **Real-time**: Updates automatically when recruiters take actions  
✅ **Transparent**: Students see exactly what's happening with their applications  
✅ **Engaging**: Motivates students by showing recruiter interest

## Future Enhancements

### Profile Update Tracking
Create `profile_updates` table to track when students update their own profiles:

```sql
CREATE TABLE profile_updates (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  student_id UUID REFERENCES students(id),
  section VARCHAR(50), -- 'education', 'skills', 'experience'
  action VARCHAR(50),  -- 'added', 'updated', 'removed'
  details JSONB,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

This would show activities like:
- "You added Python to your skills"
- "You updated your education"
- "You completed your profile"

### Better Filtering
Add `student_id` columns to tables that currently only have `candidate_name`:
- `pipeline_candidates.student_id`
- `offers.student_id`

This would improve real-time filtering efficiency.

### Notification System
Integrate with notification service to:
- Send push notifications for new activities
- Show unread count badge
- Mark activities as read/unread

## Testing

1. **Add Sample Data**: Use recruiter dashboard to shortlist a student
2. **Check Console**: Look for student activity logs
3. **Verify Display**: Activities should appear in student dashboard
4. **Test Real-time**: Make changes in recruiter view, see updates in student view

## Files Changed

- ✅ Created: `src/services/studentActivityService.js`
- ✅ Created: `src/hooks/useStudentRealtimeActivities.js`
- ✅ Modified: `src/components/Students/components/Dashboard.jsx`

## Migration from Mock Data

**Before:**
```javascript
const recentUpdates = mockRecentUpdates; // Hardcoded mock data
```

**After:**
```javascript
const { activities: recentActivities } = useStudentRealtimeActivities(userEmail, 10);
const recentUpdates = recentActivities.length > 0 ? recentActivities : mockRecentUpdates;
```

Mock data is now only used as fallback when no real activities exist.
