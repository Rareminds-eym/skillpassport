# AI Job Matching Fix - Same Jobs for All Students

## Problem Identified

The AI-matched job opportunities were showing the same jobs for all students because:

1. **Insufficient dependency tracking**: The `useAIJobMatching` hook was only watching `studentProfile?.id` in its dependency array
2. **No student-specific caching**: The cache wasn't using student identifiers, potentially causing cache collisions
3. **Limited logging**: Insufficient logging made it hard to debug which student was being matched

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Dependency Array (`src/hooks/useAIJobMatching.js`)

**Before:**
```javascript
}, [studentProfile?.id, enabled, topN]);
```

**After:**
```javascript
}, [
  studentProfile?.id, 
  studentProfile?.email,
  studentProfile?.department,
  studentProfile?.profile?.department,
  studentProfile?.profile?.branch_field,
  JSON.stringify(studentProfile?.profile?.technicalSkills || []),
  JSON.stringify(studentProfile?.profile?.technical_skills || []),
  enabled, 
  topN
]);
```

**Why:** Now the hook will re-run AI matching whenever:
- Student ID changes (different student)
- Student email changes
- Student department changes
- Student's technical skills change
- The profile structure changes

### 2. Student-Specific Caching (`src/services/aiJobMatchingService.js`)

**Added:**
```javascript
// Get student identifier for logging and caching
const studentId = studentProfile?.id || studentProfile?.email || studentProfile?.profile?.email || 'unknown';
const studentEmail = studentProfile?.email || studentProfile?.profile?.email || 'unknown@email.com';

// Create cache key specific to this student and opportunities
const opportunitiesHash = opportunities.map(o => o.id).sort().join(',');
const cacheKey = `${studentId}_${opportunitiesHash}_${topN}`;

// Check cache
const cached = matchCache.get(cacheKey);
if (cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < CACHE_DURATION) {
  console.log('✅ Using cached matches for student:', studentEmail);
  return cached.matches;
}
```

**Why:** Each student now has their own cache entry, preventing one student's results from being returned to another.

### 3. Enhanced Logging

**Added detailed logging:**
```javascript
console.log('👤 Matching for Student:', {
  id: studentId,
  email: studentEmail,
  name: studentProfile?.name || studentProfile?.profile?.name || 'Unknown'
});
console.log('🎯 Student Department:', studentData.department);
console.log('🛠️ Student Skills:', studentData.technical_skills.map(s => s.name).join(', '));
```

**Why:** Makes it easy to verify that different students are getting different matches.

### 4. Cache Storage

**Added:**
```javascript
// Cache the results
matchCache.set(cacheKey, {
  matches: enrichedMatches,
  timestamp: Date.now()
});
```

**Why:** Stores student-specific results for 5 minutes to reduce API calls while ensuring personalized results.

## How to Test

### Test 1: Different Students Get Different Matches

1. **Login as Student 1**
   - Email: `student1@example.com`
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Navigate to Dashboard
   - Look for logs showing student email and department
   - Note the matched jobs displayed

2. **Login as Student 2** (with different skills/department)
   - Email: `student2@example.com`
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Navigate to Dashboard
   - Look for logs showing different student email/department
   - **Verify**: Matched jobs should be DIFFERENT from Student 1

### Test 2: Check Console Logs

Look for these log entries in browser console:

```
🤖 AI Job Matching: Starting analysis...
👤 Matching for Student: { id: 123, email: "student@example.com", name: "John Doe" }
🎯 Student Department: Computer Science
🛠️ Student Skills: JavaScript, Python, React
📋 Extracted Student Data: { name: "John Doe", department: "Computer Science", ... }
```

**What to verify:**
- Different students show different emails
- Different students show different departments
- Different students show different skills
- Each student gets matches relevant to THEIR profile

### Test 3: Cache Validation

1. **First Load** - Should see:
   ```
   🚀 Sending request to OpenRouter...
   ✅ AI Response received successfully
   💾 Caching matches for student: student@example.com
   ```

2. **Refresh Page** (within 5 minutes) - Should see:
   ```
   ✅ Using cached matches for student: student@example.com
   ```

3. **Switch to different student** - Should see:
   ```
   🚀 Sending request to OpenRouter... (new API call for different student)
   💾 Caching matches for student: otherstudent@example.com
   ```

### Test 4: Skill-Based Matching

**Create test scenarios:**

**Student A (Food Science):**
- Department: Food Science
- Skills: Quality Management, HACCP, Food Safety
- **Expected**: Quality Analyst, Food Safety Officer, QC Inspector jobs

**Student B (Computer Science):**
- Department: Computer Science
- Skills: JavaScript, React, Node.js
- **Expected**: Software Developer, Frontend Developer, Full Stack jobs

**Student C (No specific skills):**
- Department: General
- Skills: Communication, Teamwork
- **Expected**: Entry-level jobs, general positions

### Test 5: Refresh Matches Button

1. Click "Refresh Job Matches" button
2. Should see loading spinner
3. Should trigger new AI matching
4. Console should show:
   ```
   🎯 useAIJobMatching: Starting job matching for student
   👤 Student Profile: { ... }
   ```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **Each student sees personalized job matches based on:**
- Their department/field of study
- Their technical skills
- Their soft skills
- Their experience level
- Their training and certifications

✅ **Cache works correctly:**
- Each student has separate cache entries
- Cache expires after 5 minutes
- Switching students triggers new matches

✅ **Logs clearly show:**
- Which student is being matched
- What skills/department are being considered
- Whether cached or fresh results are being used

## Debugging Tips

If students still see the same jobs:

1. **Clear cache:**
   ```javascript
   // Run in browser console
   location.reload(true);
   ```

2. **Check student profile data:**
   ```javascript
   // Run in browser console
   const email = localStorage.getItem('userEmail');
   console.log('Current user:', email);
   ```

3. **Check if profiles are different:**
   - Verify students have different departments
   - Verify students have different skills
   - Check database: `SELECT id, email, department FROM students WHERE email IN ('student1@email.com', 'student2@email.com')`

4. **Force refresh:**
   - Click "Refresh Job Matches" button
   - This bypasses cache and forces new AI matching

## Technical Details

### Cache Key Structure
```
{studentId}_{opportunitiesHash}_{topN}
```

Example:
```
123_1,2,3,4,5_3  // Student 123, opportunities 1-5, top 3 matches
456_1,2,3,4,5_3  // Student 456, same opportunities, top 3 matches
```

### Cache Duration
- **5 minutes** (300,000 ms)
- Adjustable via `CACHE_DURATION` constant
- Automatic expiration on next request

### Dependency Tracking
The hook re-runs when ANY of these change:
- Student ID
- Student email
- Student department (any field)
- Student technical skills (deep comparison via JSON.stringify)
- Enable/disable flag
- Number of matches requested

## Files Modified

1. `src/hooks/useAIJobMatching.js` - Enhanced dependency array, added logging
2. `src/services/aiJobMatchingService.js` - Student-specific caching, enhanced logging

## Next Steps

1. **Test with real students** who have different profiles
2. **Monitor console logs** to verify personalized matching
3. **Check AI match scores** - should vary based on student profile
4. **Verify cache is working** - second load should use cached results
5. **Test refresh button** - should force new matching

## Success Criteria

✅ Student A (Food Science) sees Food Safety/QA jobs  
✅ Student B (Computer Science) sees Developer jobs  
✅ Student C (different profile) sees different jobs  
✅ Cache prevents duplicate API calls for same student  
✅ Refresh button works correctly  
✅ Console logs show correct student identification
