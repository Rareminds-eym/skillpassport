## 🎨 Visual Flow

### BEFORE (Complex):
```

❌ Need to verify email
❌ Need specific password
❌ Hard to test multiple users
```

### Login Examples (All Work!):
```
1. demo@test.com / password123
2. student@university.edu / test
3. alice@example.com / anything
4. bob@demo.org / whatever

**Each creates a separate Supabase account with own data!**
