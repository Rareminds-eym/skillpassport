- Key Skills: ${profile.technicalSkills.slice(0, 3).map(s => s.name).join(', ') || 'Skills from your profile'}

**Top Matches:**

1. **[Exact Job Title from Database]** (ID: X) - Match: 85%
   - Company: [From database or 'Not specified']
   - Location: [From database] | Mode: [From database]
   - Why it fits: Your [specific skill] directly aligns with their requirements
   - Skills gap: [Honest assessment - if none, say 'Great fit!']

Would you like details on any of these, or should I filter by location/type?"

I noticed your skills aren't listed in your profile yet. Adding your technical skills would help me find much better matches for you!

I can give you some guidance based on your profile, but I'd be able to provide much more personalized recommendations if you complete our career assessment.

**The assessment reveals:**
- Your RIASEC interest profile
- Personality-career fit
- AI-matched career recommendations

Would you like to take the assessment first, or should I share some initial thoughts based on your current profile?"
