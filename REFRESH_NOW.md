## All Fixes Applied ✅

I've fixed the student name display issue:

### What Was Fixed
- ✅ `appliedJobsService.js` now queries `students.id` (not `user_id`)
- ✅ Student mapping now uses `students.id` as the key
- ✅ Both pipeline and applied jobs services are now consistent

### What to Do
1. **Hard refresh**: **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)
2. **Go to applicants page**
3. **Check the names** - they should now display correctly!

### Expected Result
- ✅ Student names: "John Doe" (not "Unknown")
- ✅ Student emails: "john@example.com" (not "N/A")
- ✅ Console shows: `count: 1` with student data

**Just refresh and it should work!** 🚀
