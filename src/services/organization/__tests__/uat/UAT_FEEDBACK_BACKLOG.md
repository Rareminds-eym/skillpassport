3. **Manual renewal only**: Auto-renewal requires manual confirmation for large orders
4. **No SSO integration**: Members must use email/password authentication

### Planned for Future Releases
1. Multiple payment methods support
2. Prorated refunds for seat reductions
3. Fully automated renewal for all order sizes
4. SSO/SAML integration for enterprise organizations
