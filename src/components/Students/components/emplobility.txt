🎯 Purpose of the Employability Score
The Employability Score quantifies how ready a student is for the future world of work — combining academic, behavioral, digital, and social dimensions.
It should:
Help schools identify students needing intervention.
Give employers or higher-ed institutions a measurable indicator of soft + hard skills.
Encourage students to build balanced skills across academics, communication, and attitude.

📊 Scoring Logic
Each skill area already has a Teacher Rating (1–5) and Evidence Verification (Yes/No) in the Skill Passport.
You can convert this into a normalized score:
For each skill:
Skill Score = (Teacher Rating / 5) × Evidence Weight
Then aggregate across all skill categories with weights:
Employability Score (0–100) =
(Σ Category Average × Category Weight) + (Bonus Points)
Bonus Points (max +5)
+2 if all skill evidences verified
+1 if participated in Hackathon / Internship
+2 if Certified in any Skill Passport Course
So, a final scale looks like:
