# Navigation Updates - Header Integration

## Changes Implemented

### ✅ Updated Top Navigation Bar to Navigate to Separate Pages

**File Modified:** `src/components/Students/components/Header.jsx`

### Desktop Navigation

Updated all navigation buttons in the top header to navigate to their respective dedicated pages:

#### **Navigation Mappings:**

1. **Dashboard** → `/student/dashboard`
   - Shows the main dashboard with overview of all sections
   - Recent Updates and Suggested Next Steps visible in sidebar

2. **My Skills** → `/student/my-skills`
   - Dedicated page for technical and soft skills
   - Full view with edit capabilities

3. **My Training** → `/student/my-training`
   - Dedicated page for courses and certifications
   - Grid layout with progress tracking

4. **My Experience** → `/student/my-experience`
   - Dedicated page for work experience
   - Timeline view with detailed information

5. **Opportunities** → `/student/opportunities`
   - Dedicated page for all opportunities
   - Search and filter functionality

6. **Share Passport** → Opens modal
   - No navigation, shows share modal

### Mobile Navigation

Also updated the mobile hamburger menu with the same navigation logic:
- All menu items navigate to their respective pages
- Menu closes automatically after selection
- Same routing as desktop navigation

## Previous Behavior vs New Behavior

### ❌ **Before:**
- Clicking nav items would navigate to `/student/dashboard` with localStorage
- Dashboard would try to show different content based on localStorage value
- All content remained on one page

### ✅ **After:**
- Clicking **My Skills** → Navigates to `/student/my-skills` (dedicated page)
- Clicking **My Training** → Navigates to `/student/my-training` (dedicated page)
- Clicking **My Experience** → Navigates to `/student/my-experience` (dedicated page)
- Clicking **Opportunities** → Navigates to `/student/opportunities` (dedicated page)
- Clicking **Dashboard** → Navigates to `/student/dashboard` (overview page)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Header.jsx Navigation Logic

**Desktop Navigation:**
```javascript
onClick={() => {
  setActiveTab(tab.id);
  if (tab.id === 'share') {
    setShowShareModal(true);
  } else if (tab.id === 'skills') {
    navigate('/student/my-skills');
  } else if (tab.id === 'training') {
    navigate('/student/my-training');
  } else if (tab.id === 'experience') {
    navigate('/student/my-experience');
  } else if (tab.id === 'opportunities') {
    navigate('/student/opportunities');
  }
}}
```

**Mobile Navigation:**
- Same logic as desktop
- Added `setMobileMenuOpen(false)` to close menu after selection

### Routes Configuration (AppRoutes.jsx)

All routes properly configured under `/student/*`:
```javascript
<Route path="dashboard" element={<StudentDashboard />} />
<Route path="my-skills" element={<MySkills />} />
<Route path="my-training" element={<MyTraining />} />
<Route path="my-experience" element={<MyExperience />} />
<Route path="opportunities" element={<Opportunities />} />
```
