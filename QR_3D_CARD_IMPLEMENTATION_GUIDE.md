# QR Code & 3D Student Card Implementation - Complete Guide

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### What Has Been Implemented

#### 1. **Unique QR Code Generation for Each Student**

**Location:** `/app/src/pages/student/Dashboard.jsx`

- Each student now has a unique QR code displayed on their dashboard
- QR code is generated using the student's email address
- Links to: `{origin}/student/profile/{email}`
- Displays "PASSPORT-ID" using either:
  - Student's `passport_id` from database, OR
  - Student's `id` (first 8 characters), OR  
  - Fallback to email prefix
- QR code is located in a purple gradient card on the left sidebar of the dashboard

**Code Implementation:**
```jsx
// QR Code Value - Unique per student
const qrCodeValue = React.useMemo(() => {
  const email = userEmail || 'student';
  return `${window.location.origin}/student/profile/${email}`;
}, [userEmail]);

// Display with unique passport ID
<CardTitle>
  PASSPORT-ID: {studentData?.passport_id || 
               studentData?.id?.toUpperCase().slice(0, 8) || 
               'STUDENT'}
</CardTitle>
```

#### 2. **3D Student Card Component**

**Location:** `/app/src/components/Students/components/StudentCard3D.jsx`

A fully interactive 3D card that displays when a QR code is scanned:

**Features:**
- ✅ **3D Perspective Effect**: Mouse-move responsive tilt animation
- ✅ **Complete Student Information**:
  - Profile photo or avatar
  - Full name, university, department
  - Student ID (unique identifier)
  - Email and phone (if available)
  - Education details (degree, level, year, CGPA)
  - Employability score with animated progress bar
  - Skills overview (technical & soft skills)
  - QR code for profile sharing
- ✅ **Verification Badge**: Green badge if student is verified
- ✅ **Modern Design**: 
  - Gradient blue/purple theme
  - Glassmorphism effects
  - Smooth animations
  - Yellow accent bar (matching reference image)

**3D Animation Code:**
```jsx
const handleMouseMove = (e) => {
  const card = e.currentTarget;
  const rect = card.getBoundingClientRect();
  const x = e.clientX - rect.left;
  const y = e.clientY - rect.top;
  
  const centerX = rect.width / 2;
  const centerY = rect.height / 2;
  
  const rotateX = ((y - centerY) / centerY) * -10;
  const rotateY = ((x - centerX) / centerX) * 10;
  
  setTiltStyle({
    transform: `perspective(1000px) rotateX(${rotateX}deg) rotateY(${rotateY}deg) scale3d(1.02, 1.02, 1.02)`,
    transition: 'transform 0.1s ease-out'
  });
};
```

#### 3. **Smart Routing Logic**

**Location:** `/app/src/pages/student/Profile.jsx`

The Profile component now intelligently detects whether:
- It's the user viewing their own profile → Shows edit interface
- It's someone else viewing via QR scan → Shows 3D card

```jsx
const Profile = () => {
  const { email } = useParams();
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  // If accessed with email param and it's not current user, show 3D card
  const isQRScan = email && email !== user?.email;
  
  if (isQRScan) {
    return <StudentCard3D />;
  }
  
  return <ProfileEditSection profileEmail={email} />;
};
```

**Routes Added:**
- `/student/dashboard/:id` - Direct access via student ID
- `/student/profile/:email` - Access via email (QR code target)

---

#### 4. **Database Integration**

The implementation uses existing Supabase infrastructure:

**Data Source:** 
- Students table with JSONB profile column
- Real-time data fetching via `useStudentDataByEmail` hook
- Automatic updates when profile changes

**Fields Used:**
```javascript
{
  id: "unique-student-id",
  passport_id: "SP-XXXXX",
  name: "Student Name",
  email: "student@university.edu",
  phone: "+1234567890",
  university: "University Name",
  department: "Department Name",
  photo: "photo-url",
  verified: true/false,
  employability_score: 75,
  education: [...],
  technicalSkills: [...],
  softSkills: [...]
}
```

---

### How It Works - User Flow

1. **Student Dashboard:**
   - Student logs in and sees their dashboard
   - QR code is visible in the left sidebar (purple card)
   - QR code contains unique link: `https://yourapp.com/student/profile/{email}`

2. **Scanning QR Code:**
   - Anyone scans the QR code with their phone
   - Opens the unique student profile URL
   - System detects it's a different user viewing the profile

3. **3D Card Display:**
   - StudentCard3D component loads
   - Fetches student data from Supabase
   - Displays interactive 3D card with all information
   - User can hover to see 3D tilt effect
   - Shows verification badge if student is verified

4. **Profile Sharing:**
   - The 3D card itself contains a QR code
   - Can be shared further for easy profile access
   - All data is pulled from the database in real-time

### Testing the Implementation

**To Test:**

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   sudo supervisorctl status
   # Ensure frontend is RUNNING
   ```

2. **Login as a student:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/login/student`
   - Use valid student credentials from Supabase

3. **View QR Code:**
   - After login, go to dashboard
   - See the purple QR code card in the left sidebar
   - Note your unique PASSPORT-ID

4. **Scan QR Code:**
   - Use phone camera or QR scanner app
   - Scan the QR code
   - Should open `/student/profile/{your-email}`

5. **View 3D Card:**
   - When opened via QR (different user), see 3D card
   - Move mouse to see tilt effect
   - Verify all information is displayed
   - Check verification badge status

6. **Alternative Test:**
   - Manually visit: `http://localhost:5173/student/profile/{any-student-email}`
   - Should show 3D card if it's not your email

### Environment Variables Required

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://dpooleduinyyzxgrcwko.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

✅ Already configured in `/app/.env`

---

### Database Requirements

The `students` table should have:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  passport_id TEXT UNIQUE,
  email TEXT UNIQUE,
  name TEXT,
  phone TEXT,
  photo TEXT,
  university TEXT,
  department TEXT,
  verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  employability_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  profile JSONB, -- Contains education, skills, etc.
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Note:** The implementation uses the JSONB `profile` column for nested data.

---

### Unique QR Code Verification

Each student gets a unique QR because:

1. **Email-based URL:** Each student has a unique email
   - QR value: `https://app.com/student/profile/john@university.edu`
   - Another student: `https://app.com/student/profile/jane@university.edu`

2. **Student ID-based Passport:** Display shows unique ID
   - Student 1: `PASSPORT-ID: ABC12345`
   - Student 2: `PASSPORT-ID: XYZ67890`

3. **Database-driven:** All data fetched per student
   - Different student = different data = different card

---

### Customization Options

**To customize the 3D card:**

1. **Colors:** Edit gradient in `StudentCard3D.jsx`
   ```jsx
   className="bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-600 via-blue-700 to-purple-700"
   ```

2. **Tilt Sensitivity:** Adjust rotation angles
   ```jsx
   const rotateX = ((y - centerY) / centerY) * -10; // Change -10
   const rotateY = ((x - centerX) / centerX) * 10;  // Change 10
   ```

3. **QR Code Size:** Modify in Dashboard.jsx
   ```jsx
   <QRCodeSVG value={qrCodeValue} size={180} /> // Change size
   ```

4. **Fields Displayed:** Add/remove sections in StudentCard3D
