## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If No Jobs Show Up:

1. **Check Opportunities Table**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM opportunities 
   WHERE is_active = true AND status != 'draft';
   ```

2. **Check Student Profile**:
   - Ensure profile JSONB has data
   - Verify technicalSkills array exists

3. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Look for error messages
   - Check Network tab for API calls

4. **Verify API Key**:
   - Key should start with `sk-or-v1-`
   - Check for any 401/403 errors

### If AI Takes Too Long:

- Normal: 3-8 seconds for matching
- Many opportunities (50+): Up to 15 seconds
- Check OpenRouter API status if >30 seconds

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Ensure Complete Profiles**:

2. **Quality Opportunities Data**:
   - Fill `skills_required` JSONB array
   - Add detailed `requirements` and `responsibilities`
