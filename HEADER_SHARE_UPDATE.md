# Header Share Modal Update

## Overview
Updated the Header component's share modal to use the same personalized profile link as the QR code section.

## Changes Made

### File Updated
- `src/components/Students/components/Header.jsx`

### Key Updates

#### 1. **Profile Link Generation**
- Now retrieves user email from localStorage
- Generates personalized link: `{origin}/student/profile/{email}`
- Uses `useMemo` hook for performance optimization
- Same link format as ProfileHeroEdit component

#### 2. **Enhanced Copy Functionality**
- Added visual feedback with checkmark icon when copied
- Auto-resets after 2 seconds
- Improved user experience

#### 3. **Updated Share Modal**
All share buttons now use the personalized profile link:
- **Native Share API** - For mobile devices
- **WhatsApp** - Direct sharing
- **Telegram** - Instant messaging
- **LinkedIn** - Professional network
- **Email** - Email sharing
- **Copy Link** - Manual copy with visual feedback

#### 4. **Improved UI/UX**
- Better modal layout with grid design
- Enhanced button styling
- Added LinkedIn share option
- Improved spacing and visual hierarchy
- Copy button with icon feedback

### Technical Implementation

```javascript
// Profile link generation (matches ProfileHeroEdit)
const userEmail = localStorage.getItem('userEmail');
const profileLink = useMemo(() => {
  const email = userEmail || 'student';
  return `${window.location.origin}/student/profile/${email}`;
}, [userEmail]);

// Copy with feedback
const handleCopyLink = () => {
  navigator.clipboard.writeText(profileLink);
  setCopied(true);
  setTimeout(() => setCopied(false), 2000);
};
```

### Consistency Achieved

Both share locations now use the same link:
- ✅ **ProfileHeroEdit** (QR Code section) → `/student/profile/{email}`
- ✅ **Header** (Share Passport button) → `/student/profile/{email}`

### Benefits

1. **Personalized Sharing** - Each student shares their unique profile
2. **Consistent Experience** - Same link everywhere
3. **Better Tracking** - Email-based profile URLs
4. **Professional** - Direct access to individual profiles
5. **SEO Friendly** - Unique URLs for each student

2. Modal opens with personalized profile link
3. Student can:
   - Use native device sharing (mobile)
