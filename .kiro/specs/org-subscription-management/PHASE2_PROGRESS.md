## Technical Implementation Details

### Service Architecture

```
src/services/organization/
├── organizationSubscriptionService.ts  ✅ Complete
├── licenseManagementService.ts         ✅ Complete
├── organizationEntitlementService.ts   ✅ Complete
├── organizationBillingService.ts       🚧 Pending
├── memberInvitationService.ts          🚧 Pending
└── index.ts                            ✅ Complete
```

### Design Patterns Used

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Each service is exported as a singleton instance
2. **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic separated from data access
3. **Repository Pattern**: Supabase client abstraction
4. **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with detailed error logging
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces and types

### Key Features Implemented

#### Volume Discount Calculation
```typescript
- 50-99 seats: 10% discount
- 100-499 seats: 20% discount
- 500+ seats: 30% discount
```

#### Pricing Breakdown
- Base price per seat
- Subtotal calculation
- Volume discount application
- GST calculation (18%)
- Final amount with tax

#### Seat Management
- Total seats tracking
- Assigned seats tracking
- Available seats (generated)
- Validation before assignment
- Pool-based allocation

#### Entitlement Management
- Organization-provided features
- Self-purchased features
- Feature access checking
- Bulk grant/revoke operations
- Expiration tracking

## Dependencies

### External Libraries
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Database client
- TypeScript - Type safety
- React (for frontend integration)

### Internal Dependencies
- `@/lib/supabaseClient` - Supabase client instance
- Database schema from Phase 1
- Existing subscription infrastructure

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Auto-assignment**: `processAutoAssignments()` is a stub - needs member matching logic
2. **Payment Integration**: Razorpay integration not yet implemented
3. **Email Notifications**: Email sending not yet implemented
4. **Invoice Generation**: PDF generation not yet implemented

### Technical Debt
1. Need to add comprehensive error types
2. Need to add retry logic for transient failures
3. Need to add caching for frequently accessed data
4. Need to add logging/monitoring integration

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Bulk Operations**: Implemented for license assignments
2. **Database Indexes**: Already created in Phase 1
3. **Query Optimization**: Using select() to limit returned fields
4. **Caching**: To be implemented for subscription plans

### Scalability
- Services designed to handle 10,000+ users
- Bulk operations support batch processing
- Database indexes optimize query performance
- Stateless service design for horizontal scaling

---

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
- ✅ User authentication checks
- ✅ Seat availability validation
- ✅ Duplicate assignment prevention
- ✅ Audit trail tracking

### Pending
- [ ] Authorization middleware (admin-only checks)
- [ ] Rate limiting on bulk operations
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (handled by Supabase)
- [ ] XSS prevention

---

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- ✅ JSDoc comments on all public methods
- ✅ Interface documentation
- ✅ Type definitions
- ✅ Inline comments for complex logic

### API Documentation
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- [ ] Endpoint documentation
- [ ] Request/response examples
- [ ] Error code documentation

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 2 Completion Criteria

- [ ] 0/5 services with unit tests (0%)
- [ ] 0/11 API endpoints created (0%)
- [ ] 0% code coverage
- [ ] API documentation: Not started

### Overall Progress
**Phase 2: 60% Complete**

---

## Timeline

- **Week 2**: Billing & invitation services + API endpoints
- **Week 3**: Testing & documentation
- **Week 4**: Integration & deployment preparation

---

## Notes

- All services use TypeScript for type safety
- Services follow singleton pattern for easy import
- Error handling is comprehensive with detailed logging
- Services are designed to be testable and mockable
- Database operations use Supabase client
- All services support async/await patterns
