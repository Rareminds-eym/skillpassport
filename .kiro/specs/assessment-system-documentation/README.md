All consolidated files are searchable. Common search terms:
- "database" - database schema and queries
- "AI" - AI integration and analysis
- "timer" - timer system and configuration
- "resume" - resume and persistence
- "test mode" - testing and debugging
- "after 10th" - after 10th specific information
- "after 12th" - after 12th specific information
