# AI-Powered Student Job Alert Feature - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Feature Completed

I've successfully implemented an **AI-powered Student Job Alert system** that displays personalized job recommendations in the "Suggested Next Steps" section of the student dashboard.

---

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. **AI Job Matching Service** (`/app/src/services/aiJobMatchingService.js`)
- Integrated OpenAI (via OpenRouter) for intelligent job matching
- Analyzes student profile data:
  - Technical skills (name, level, category)
  - Soft skills (name, type)
  - Education (degree, department, university, CGPA)
  - Training/Courses (completed and ongoing)
  - Work experience (roles, organizations, duration)
  - Projects and Certificates
  
- Matches against opportunities table fields:
  - `skills_required` (JSONB)
  - `requirements` (JSONB)
  - `responsibilities` (JSONB)
  - `department`
  - `job_title`
  - `description`
  - `experience_level`
  - `experience_required`

- Returns **Top 3** best matching jobs with:
  - Match score (0-100%)
  - Detailed match reasons
  - Key matching skills
  - Personalized recommendations

### 2. **Custom React Hook** (`/app/src/hooks/useAIJobMatching.js`)
- Automated job matching on dashboard load
- Filters only **active opportunities** (not draft, deadline not passed)
- Provides loading states and error handling
- Includes manual refresh functionality

### 3. **Enhanced Dashboard UI** (`/app/src/pages/student/Dashboard.jsx`)
- **Beautiful AI Job Cards** displaying:
  - Match score badge (color-coded)
  - Job title and company name
  - Employment type, location, and deadline
  - Why the job matches (AI-generated reasoning)
  - Key matching skills as badges
  - Personalized recommendation
  
- **Visual Design**:
  - Gradient backgrounds (amber to orange)
  - Hover effects and transitions
  - Match score badges (green gradient)
  - Responsive layout with icons
  - Clickable cards (opens application link)
  
- **Fallback Behavior**:
  - Shows default suggestions if no AI matches found
  - Loading spinner during AI processing
  - Error messages with helpful context

### 4. **Environment Configuration** (`/app/.env`)
- Added OpenAI API key configuration
- Key stored securely: `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`

## üìä How It Works

1. **Student loads dashboard** ‚Üí `useAIJobMatching` hook activates
2. **Hook fetches**:
   - Student profile data (all fields from JSONB)
   - Active opportunities from database
3. **AI analyzes** student profile against all opportunities using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
4. **AI returns** top 3 best matches with scores, reasons, and recommendations
5. **Dashboard displays** beautiful job cards in "Suggested Next Steps" section
